Armor threshold is shown in the unit description which you can see by tapping on an enemy unit on the field. If tower causes more physical damage than the armor threshold, the armor breaks down and the unit gets full damage value. Armor doesn't protect units from other types of damage (fire , magic, etc)\r\n• Several fundamentally new towers:\r\n  - Fear Tower: scares enemy units, forcing them to run away from the tower for a while. One enemy can be scared only once (though some units are fearless).\r\n  - Cursed Tower: normally it shoots causing a base damage but can be charged with coins to temporarily multiply its power. If the health of the enemy unit does not exceed the base damage, the tower will kill it without spending extra-points. If the unit is strong tower will try to kill it, spending no more than enough extra-points.\r\n  - Jet Mace: shoots with a large spiked ball horizontally or vertically. It strikes several enemy units losing some destructive power each time. The ball continues to fly until it loses all the energy.\r\n  - Radioactive towers (Uranium and Plutonium): do not shoot, but continuously irradiates all units within damage radius. Golems and infected (by Plague or Poison Spider Tower) units are vulnerable to radiation.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDCW9B","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Rayman Fiesta Run Preload Edition","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.54665.9007199266379691.5fed3abd-3fa7-4b3d-9d47-eae1e4031514.da8112f2-29b2-4bdc-a3a8-5caf76cdb8d3","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.26803.9007199266379691.58bf2dcb-c8b0-4744-91d8-eb801c0fa70e.d514abf6-a643-41ae-b513-e33e620bac74","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"$0.99⁺","Price":0.99,"AverageRating":3.2,"RatingsCount":"9","PackageFamilyNames":["UbisoftEntertainment.RaymanFiestaRunPreloadEdition_dbgk1hhpxymar"],"ContentIds":["9243c4f5-b831-f90a-082c-232ce45f8021"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"***Pocket Gamer - 9/10 - “A spunky, joyous, addictive gem [...] Another giddy and breathless mix of memory and reflexes” \r\n\r\nJoin legendary platforming hero Rayman for a new adventure on your favorite mobile device! \r\n\r\nIf you enjoyed Rayman Jungle Run, winner of the App Store’s BEST of 2012, you will love Rayman Fiesta Run and its new wacky Fiesta world!

Injured ships, depending on the amount of damage, may reduce their speed and move slower. \r\n\r\nDepending on the ship type, you can hit it 1 to 4 times before it is completely destroyed. You have 10 levels to complete. If you do well you will be promoted to commander, captain, or even an admiral. The quality of shooting is determined by your score.

After the puzzles are solved, the pieces of the picture must then be rearranged to form the final image.\r\n\r\nFlipPix Jigsaw is designed specifically for Tablets and PCs and incorporates a type of logic puzzle often referred to as a nonogram or griddler.\r\n\r\nA short tutorial on the basics of the game is included.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH4NZT6","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Cross-Stitch Puzzle","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.49261.13510798887483471.f0d70d39-b9e7-4907-be56-c7a06aba4999.7b26f101-6a61-458b-9dde-efb3bf94a275","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.52242.13510798887483471.f0d70d39-b9e7-4907-be56-c7a06aba4999.14a514fe-c133-43df-a7af-5a9be5f3c893","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.15055.13510798887483471.f0d70d39-b9e7-4907-be56-c7a06aba4999.eb14e18c-4ec3-474e-988e-0fecde93f86d","Height":2160,"Width":1440,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"$7.99","Price":7.99,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["GirlsApps.CrossStitchingPuzzleCROWN-ForContinuum_nqtvbj9h3qpg8"],"ContentIds":["6ee0d26e-a77f-34ea-c13d-bd8012dac796","1d91e1f7-e3e5-4f06-15d2-cebfecfb542f"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Embroidery is one of the most ancient types of needlework and is always in fashion.

Wield magic cards instead of weapons and slay the armies of darkness in the dungeons below the Old Cathedral. Save the terror-stricken Paperverse from the clutches of the Archdemon himself! \r\n\r\nCARDS AND DECKBUILDING\r\nIt’s not a card game, but items, spells, and skills are all expressed as cards. The strategy lies in adapting your hand to each situation. Cards can be upgraded with runes and you can find many variants with diverse bonuses. Legendaries are the most epic but hard to acquire.\r\n\r\nTAILORED SESSIONS WITH FLEXISCOPE\r\nBook of Demons respects your time. It features the Flexiscope engine which allows you to divide the game into sessions of any size. It even learns your pace of gaming and predicts the time to complete the next session.\r\n\r\nUNIQUE MECHANICS\r\nSimplified movement and fight mechanics is where Book of Demons differs the most from other hack & slash games. There is often not enough time to click-remove all of the obstacles such as monster shields, enemy spells, poison, or knocked cards, so timing, card selection and order of execution are critical.\r\n\r\nHACK & SLASH IN THE WORLD OF PAPERVERSE\r\nBook of Demons takes place in Paperverse, a world that exists entirely inside a pop-up book. It’s a tale of good and evil about saving the world from the ultimate devilry. Sounds familiar? Inspired by the dark and gloomy atmosphere of the first Diablo game, Book of Demons is part tribute part parody of hack & slash classics.\r\n\r\nCOMFORT OF GAMEPLAY\r\nMany Book of Demons features were designed with gameplay comfort in mind. Points of interest are marked at the top of the screen and get revealed once you get closer. Your character leaves footprints, which can be used to track your way back or notice paths already visited without opening the map.\r\n\r\nCHALLENGING ENDGAME\r\nOn average it takes about 10 hours to complete the campaign with a single class, but maxing out a character and mastering all of the higher Freeplay difficulty levels and Quests takes much longer. The Roguelike mode offers another level of challenge with permadeath, restricted healing and even more obstacles to overcome.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH4VMP1","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Tibetan Quest: Beyond The World's End (Full)","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.45783.13510798887507764.40dd9a29-d90f-4a0d-bd3a-61861a62a496.a6f38384-4fa0-4e63-859e-f915cc25c5f5","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"$6.99","Price":6.99,"AverageRating":4.1,"RatingsCount":"112","PackageFamilyNames":["ArtifexMundi.TibetanQuestBeyondTheWorldsEndFull_xmkq9zz36w32m"],"ContentIds":["221f4e45-c287-1960-9369-38985ae37c0f","dd90ebb8-6519-721a-7975-63d5d8f2b36e"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"FANTASTIC HIDDEN OBJECT PUZZLE ADVENTURE GAME FROM THE CREATORS OF ENIGMATIS AND GRIM LEGENDS!\nJourney to the mystical city of Shangri-La and find your missing niece!

Their first book of fairytales that was published back in 1812 included about 200 fairy tales making those brothers one of the most famous storytellers of folk tales, which made stories like 'Cinderella', 'The Frog Prince', 'Hansel and Gretel', 'Rapunzel', Sleeping Beauty' and 'Snow White' to be well-known all around the world. Even though it is known that those tales are collected, there are numerous discussions about the ideology behind those tales sometimes being criticized for the certain note of violence and crudity that appears in some of the stories while others debate about the possibility of including real situations when the brothers were editing those stories.\r\n\r\nDoris and Ralph are philologists that work in one of the most interesting clubs in the world. They have job as many of us would dream of. Namely this time they got a task to discover if the brothers Grimm's fairytales are based on true stories or they are simply part of someone's fantasy, no matter if brothers Grimm's or the fantasy of the folk storyteller, taken in general.\r\n\r\nDoris and Ralph are at the moment in the land where they hope that was the land where actually happened the story about Snow White and the seven dwarfs.

Plan is a puzzle adventure game that takes place entirely inside an elevator. Go floor to floor, find items, and meet a bizarre cast of characters. Discover relationships between different things in the building and unlock its secrets. \r\n\r\nIt's the most fun you can have while stuck in an elevator.\r\n\r\nFEATURES\r\nElevator-Scale VR\r\nFloor Plan: Hands-On Edition adds full support for motion controllers to the original game. Walk around the elevator, grab things, and press buttons! Or if you'd rather enjoy your buttons from a distance, you can play seated or standing with a variety of control options. \r\n\r\nClassic Genre, New Paint\r\nFloor Plan takes mechanics from your favorite classic point-and-click adventure games and reimagines them for first person VR. Whether you dream of inventory puzzles or you're a newcomer to the genre, you'll see it like you've never seen it before.\r\n\r\nPlay Your Way\r\nFigure out alternate solutions to puzzles, solve them in different orders, or call the operator if you need a nudge in the right direction.\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT\r\nFloor Plan generally takes players about an hour to complete. We've priced it accordingly, and think it has enough special moments to be memorable and something you'll want to share with friends. Thanks for checking it out!\r\n\r\nYou can reach the developers on Twitter at

With huge excitement, boys and girls decorate the Christmas tree, make sweets, deck out the house and look forward to their presents. These coloring pages depict your favorite Christmas characters and the main symbols of the festive season. The coloring process gives every kid the feeling of the Christmas holidays drawing near.\r\n\r\nPaint by numbers - an interactive coloring book for children. This mathematical game teaches children to recognize numbers and solve simple mathematical examples. In addition, this program develops memory, attention, imagination, and logical abilities.\r\nBoys and girls of all ages love to color. The simple coloring mode is suitable for the smallest of children, including those of kindergarten and preschool age. These include simple and recognizable images that are easy to color. If the child selects the wrong shape, then they will be prompted with the correct number. Therefore, the picture will always be colored correctly, and the child will quickly memorize the numbers. Children can choose to color by geometrical figures and pictograms in addition to numbers. A child can easily distinguish a square from a circle, diamond, and triangle.\r\nSchool-age children will enjoy the complex coloring mode. Here the picture is divided into a large number of elements, thus making it difficult at first to determine what it depicts. Older children can complicate the task by adding addition and subtraction tasks. Now children will need to solve the examples and choose the correct answers in order to color the picture. This will teach the child how to quickly do arithmetic in their mind.\r\nThose who are learning the alphabet can choose to color by letter. Coloring by letters will be useful for children preparing to enter primary school.\r\nTo make the coloring process more interesting and fun, you can change any of the preset colors. To do this, press and hold the jar of paint and a palette will open. Then you can choose your favorite color. Thus, all the shaded areas of the image can be changed in the coloring by number mode. You can have fun by changing the color scheme to suit your taste.

Moreover, once you manage to reach the bottom level of the dungeon and slay Lord Slyn, you'll also have to fight your way and survive the road back to the surface.\r\n\r\nMultiple player classes with awesome abilities\r\n\r\nBefore starting your quest you will have to choose one of the five possible hero classes: fighter, mage, paladin, priest, and ranger.\r\n\r\nEach of these classes come with unique strengths and weaknesses that will require a different approach when confronting the enemies from the dungeon.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, as most rogulike games, death is final so advance carefully and engage in battles only when you're sure you can come out victorious or you'll have to start the adventure from the very beginning.\r\n\r\nBesides monsters, the dungeon is also the place where you will find lots of weapons, equipment and consumables with different properties. While some can give you an instant boost to your skills, other can be cursed and besides their negative effects will bind to your hero needing you to remove their curse if you want to get rid of them.\r\n\r\nSpell books, potions, and magic wands can also be found during your adventure but, will require identification scrolls if you don't want to risk casting a curse on yourself or drinking a deadly potion.\r\n\r\nThe game packs lots of content regarding weapons, equipment, and other consumables which combined with the random dungeon generator, makes it deliver a completely unique experience each time you play it.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDNMJX","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Kindergarten and Preschool Animated Puzzle Learning Games with Letters and Animals for children","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.17025.9007199266605487.bd8f845e-d009-4a2f-b9cf-e20c8aa75a69.34ef30da-e5d4-48a5-8c52-180cbd68490e","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"$0.99","Price":0.99,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["18224boogygames.17522244BC56B_3has56vqfsc8c"],"ContentIds":["11f58af2-603a-6436-24e5-643fff4f1d87"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"This is a great learning game for kids 3-7 years old!

Two of these creatures, humans and demons, have been struggling against each other for many years. As the centuries passed, control shifted from demons to humans and back again. The humans finally earned a clear victory after the First Neverland War. But this left the country in ruins and was the direct cause of the Second Neverland War, which saw the decisive victory of the demons once again. \r\n\r\nMagic Age 1053\r\nTragedy strikes the small woodland village of Petun, the town is attacked and burned to the ground by vicious Neverland troops. But Petun is only the first of many massacres; the Demon Army tears through every human village it can find, slaughtering the people as it goes. Humiliated and infuriated by these abuses, the humans begin to resist and fight back. \r\nIt starts as a rash of disorganized, sporadic riots. But it soon grows into something more, something meaningful. These uprisings become a beacon of hope to all humans, spurring them on to unite and form a new empire. They choose a name to reflect their most noble traditions, to reflect a time when they ruled over the demon horde. They call it the Reformed Simba Empire. \r\n\r\nPetun?little more than a bump in the road, a mark on a map. But this is where it all started, where the undercurrent of disdain and hatred overflowed into a bloody torrent of death and destruction, drowning Neverland in war for years to come. \r\nThis is where our story begins?the story of the Seven Year War.\r\n\r\n* This game does require a Microsoft XInput controller if not played on a touch enabled Tablet device.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRFHV3K","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Reckless Racing Ultimate","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.22218.9007199266248172.58ad1c1e-d0b6-4c18-8cbb-76036c2efeba.4826b164-f73c-491f-adb6-53cc7799aac2","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#186A29","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.58365.9007199266248172.1b4e075e-8307-492a-97ae-6f0a9ef4d9c7.eef1b426-30c8-44fd-bedb-58d70a8f9fb0","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#186A29","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.34785.9007199266248172.b763a8a9-7fa3-4ef0-b5c6-5a6c18d62359.68bb9267-7b18-4352-adbb-7fa27c071a4c","Height":210,"Width":210,"BackgroundColor":"#186A29","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.19524.9007199266248172.23834f0c-1189-4405-b1c2-44347ba8441b.35fe7d82-d3e1-4daa-9c8c-c4ed6073a804","Height":210,"Width":434,"BackgroundColor":"#186A29","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.64995.9007199266248172.90736933-474d-4ec3-9aed-cf83bb315896.29f30bf8-83be-456a-9dbf-ba3f238e04c6","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#186A29","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.41479.9007199266248172.3ae4aba9-1e12-446b-9487-888cbd46df0a.9cb82cc6-2ed9-429c-8d12-747ea89e6df7","Height":270,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#186A29","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"$4.99","Price":4.99,"AverageRating":3.6,"RatingsCount":"403","PackageFamilyNames":["Microsoft.Studios.RecklessRacingUltimate_8wekyb3d8bbwe"],"ContentIds":["e851cbd6-434e-2ce8-5e20-9f55395fdab4"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"The ultimate edition of the acclaimed Reckless Racing top-down racer series is here and exclusive to Windows 8.

Dogs are the most devoted friends. You can teach your cute puppy different commands. You can play ball, travel, and just take care of it. Dogs also have a great nose and are the best detectives! In exchange for their service, each dog dreams about a tasty bone! In this coloring book, you will find exciting scenes from the life of dogs of various breeds.\n\nPaint by numbers - an interactive coloring book for children. This mathematical game teaches children to recognize numbers and solve simple mathematical examples. In addition, this program develops memory, attention, imagination, and logical abilities.\nBoys and girls of all ages love to color. The simple coloring mode is suitable for the smallest of children, including those of kindergarten and preschool age. These include simple and recognizable images that are easy to color. If the child selects the wrong shape, then they will be prompted with the correct number. Therefore, the picture will always be colored correctly, and the child will quickly memorize the numbers. Children can choose to color by geometrical figures and pictograms in addition to numbers. A child can easily distinguish a square from a circle, diamond, and triangle.\nSchool-age children will enjoy the complex coloring mode. Here the picture is divided into a large number of elements, thus making it difficult at first to determine what it depicts. Older children can complicate the task by adding addition and subtraction tasks. Now children will need to solve the examples and choose the correct answers in order to color the picture. This will teach the child how to quickly do arithmetic in their mind.\nThose who are learning the alphabet can choose to color by letter. Coloring by letters will be useful for children preparing to enter primary school.\nTo make the coloring process more interesting and fun, you can change any of the preset colors. To do this, press and hold the jar of paint and a palette will open. Then you can choose your favorite color. Thus, all the shaded areas of the image can be changed in the coloring by number mode. You can have fun by changing the color scheme to suit your taste.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9MVB2MSMPXCQ","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"ACA NEOGEO REAL BOUT FATAL FURY","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.17091.13796541189113855.08b66faa-597b-4705-9288-999c51bff436.b892a877-d665-4e0a-8186-6f259b2817a2","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.31226.13796541189113855.08b66faa-597b-4705-9288-999c51bff436.156a31b1-aeab-4d13-9ea9-d34f721af19a","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.57873.13796541189113855.08b66faa-597b-4705-9288-999c51bff436.3e6e36c1-76cf-45ea-a8e3-be7de5bba8c1","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.63891.13796541189113855.08b66faa-597b-4705-9288-999c51bff436.aa6b2733-01be-4593-ac8f-545fd9a58571","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.64171.13796541189113855.08b66faa-597b-4705-9288-999c51bff436.2cd20355-0691-40d0-8a59-85840231bafe","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"$7.99","Price":7.99,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["HAMSTERCorporation.ACANEOGEOREALBOUTFATALFURY_7xd3265gdqs6r"],"ContentIds":["5433dcb7-b5c4-e995-bf98-b50089da3182"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"REAL BOUT FATAL FURY is a fighting game released by SNK in 1995.\r\nUsing the previous system as a base, isolating the Sweep Button, the inclusion of Combination Attacks, \r\nand other elements such as ring outs make for an even speedier and tempo-based play style.\r\nSixteen fighters battle it out to see who is the strongest.\r\n\r\nThe \"ACA NEOGEO\" series has faithfully reproduced many classic NEOGEO masterpieces.\r\nPlayers can change various game settings such as game difficulty, and also reproduce the atmosphere of arcade display settings at that time.
