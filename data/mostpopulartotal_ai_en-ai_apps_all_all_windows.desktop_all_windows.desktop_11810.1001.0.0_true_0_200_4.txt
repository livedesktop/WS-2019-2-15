The Tetris game was created by Alexey Pajitnov in 1984—the product of Alexey’s computer programming experience and his love of puzzles. In the decades to follow, Tetris became one of the most successful and recognizable  games, appearing on nearly every gaming platform available. This App is based on the classic Tetris, a new development in windows10!\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE\r\n\r\nThe goal of Tetris is to score as many points as possible by clearing horizontal lines of Blocks. The player must rotate, move, and drop the falling Tetriminos inside the Matrix (playing field). Lines are cleared when they are filled with Blocks and have no empty spaces.\r\n\r\nAs lines are cleared, the level increases and Tetriminos fall faster, making the game progressively more challenging. If the Blocks land above the top of the playing field, the game is over.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel,

Release the screen and collect the points.\r\n5.\tThe longer the word the bigger the score. When you connect a 4 letter word the value of each letter is 10 points. For each additional letter the value per letter increases by 10 points.\r\n6.\tUse multipliers to increase the points per word n-fold. Multipliers can generate a maximum 100 fold increase.\r\n7.\tSometimes it is difficult to spot a word. If you like the reveal the troubling word just press on the word and a reveal menu will appear.\r\n\r\n★ ★ Support and Feedback\r\nIf you have any technical problems, please email us directly at support@gsoftteam.com.

The deep snow in the winters has made it difficult for people to move around and tourists are also planning skiing trips and you have to transport the passengers and ski gear to offroad deep snow mountain tracks. Drive the snow tourist bus and pick n drop the passengers. You also have to pick the tourists from snowy hill resorts to city. Deep snow has made it very difficult & dangerous to drive on the narrow roads of the city and off road tracks have become even more risky. Make sure you don't hit the traffic and people on the road as it is really cold due to snow blizzards and the roads have become narrower. Snowy Bus Drive is a challenging game testing driving skills in risky and dangerous conditions and difficult paths. Hill drivers are really experts in cutting those hilly corners and curves but snow adds to the risk and challenge. Tourists in the mountain top resorts are depending for their survival on you so that they can reach the city safe and sound. Be the best snow bus driver on city and off-road conditions.\r\n\r\nUse the controls to accelerate and brake according to the conditions. Drive carefully and make sure you can see your way in the snow and control the bus on the skiddy ice. It is like a thin sheet of glass on the roads. Everything is covered in snow from the hill tops & mountain to roads to houses to hotels. The met department has reported that the snow storm is likely to keep at this pace for many days to come and people cannot use their cars to travel in this weather. Since you are one of the only few bus drivers providing the transport services in these tough hilly conditions on off-road and city roads, you have to be fast and rush to your destination to pick as many passengers as possible. People are depending upon you to reach their homes for Christmas and New Year. You are an expert snow driver who can make all this happen.\r\n\r\nYou have multiple game play missions in hilly off road conditions to complete so be ready for the kicks and excitement. Just launch into the game and drive away and you have to make sure you are driving safe. You will experience both city and off-road environment and view many scenic views of mountains and hills while you are driving in the snowy conditions.

All the books you’ve promised yourself you’ll read “one day.” \r\n\r\nThat day is now. With eBook Search you’ll catch up on all the reading you’ve missed, with a world of great literature at your fingertips. But it’s not just the classics you get with eBook Search. \r\n\r\nModern-day stories -- thrillers, mysteries, fantasies, science fiction, and more -- are there at the touch of your finger. It doesn’t matter which genre “floats your boat”, you’ll discover a huge selection to choose from. And you’ll stumble on wonderful books you’d never heard of that’ll send you down new paths of adventure and excitement. \r\n\r\nAll those wasted minutes, when you could’ve been reading “if only you’d brought a book”… are instantly transformed into hours of pleasure with eBook Search. \r\n\r\nAnd remember, you can read all of these books on any eBook or PDF reader, it doesn’t matter. There’s no need to learn how to use some new-fangled eBook reader. eBook Search puts your chosen book directly on to your favorite eBook app. \r\n\r\nBut here’s where it gets really good. Every single book you get with eBook Search -- and there’s over 2 million of them - is absolutely free. \r\n\r\nWhen your friends are handing over their hard-earned cash for an eBook from the big name stores (and moaning about the outrageous price for a book you can’t even hold in your hands), you’ll have instant access to more books than you could possibly read in a lifetime… and they won’t cost you a single cent. \r\n\r\nWhile your friends are paying $9.33 for “The Hound of the Baskervilles”, you’ll be reading it for free. While your friends are paying $14.93 for “Tom Sawyer”, you’ll be reading it for free. And it’s the same with thrillers, romances, science fiction, and more. \r\n\r\nIt’s up to you. Keep on throwing your money away buying books from those other guys -- you know the ones. Or, keep the cash in your pocket, and get 2 million free books with eBook Search.","ProductFamilyName":"Apps","Schema":"Card;1"}],"Title":"Most popular","HasThirdPartyIAPs":false,"AlgoName":"RECO-Algo-Version","TotalItems":984,"PageSize":200}}
