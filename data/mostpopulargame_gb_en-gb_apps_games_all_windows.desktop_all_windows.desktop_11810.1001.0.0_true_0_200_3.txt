on the face of the planet. These amazing animals boggle our imagination by their variety and size. Some were small like modern lizards, others as huge as a multi-storey building. Some were predators, for example the Tyrannosaurus Rex, Allosaurus, Velociraptor, Spinosaurus, while others were herbivorous - like the Diplodocus, Ankylosaurus and Iguanodon. Some species could fly, some lived in water, but most of them walked on the ancient land. Dinosaurs lived in the Mesozoic era, which is subdivided into three periods: Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous. Today, archaeologists study the remains of these animals and can only assume how they looked and lived.  \n\nPaint by numbers - an interactive coloring book for children. This mathematical game teaches children to recognize numbers and solve simple mathematical examples. In addition, this program develops memory, attention, imagination, and logical abilities.\nBoys and girls of all ages love to color. The simple coloring mode is suitable for the smallest of children, including those of kindergarten and preschool age. These include simple and recognizable images that are easy to color. If the child selects the wrong shape, then they will be prompted with the correct number. Therefore, the picture will always be colored correctly, and the child will quickly memorize the numbers. Children can choose to color by geometrical figures and pictograms in addition to numbers. A child can easily distinguish a square from a circle, diamond, and triangle.\nSchool-age children will enjoy the complex coloring mode. Here the picture is divided into a large number of elements, thus making it difficult at first to determine what it depicts. Older children can complicate the task by adding addition and subtraction tasks. Now children will need to solve the examples and choose the correct answers in order to color the picture. This will teach the child how to quickly do arithmetic in their mind.\nThose who are learning the alphabet can choose to color by letter. Coloring by letters will be useful for children preparing to enter primary school.\nTo make the coloring process more interesting and fun, you can change any of the preset colors. To do this, press and hold the jar of paint and a palette will open. Then you can choose your favorite color. Thus, all the shaded areas of the image can be changed in the coloring by number mode. You can have fun by changing the color scheme to suit your taste.

Pins aren't cleared between rounds allowing you to knock them into still upright pins.\r\n\r\nFIVE PIN BOWLING\r\n\r\n Invented in 1904 in Canada. In 5 pin, each pin is worth different point values. Spares are strategic attempts to hit the most valuable pins. A perfect game is 450 points!\r\n\r\nNINE PIN (GERMAN BOWLING)\r\n\r\nInvented in medieval Germany, 9 pin is what most later bowling games are based on. Nine pins are arranged in a diamond shape with a \"kingpin\" in the middle. Knocking all the pins over earns 9 points. Knocking all the pins over but the kingpin earns 12!\r\n\r\nLONG ALLEY SKITTLES\r\n\r\nKnock over pins by throwing a barrel-shaped 'cheese'! To score points, you first have to knock over the kingpin. It's tricky to master when the ball bounces unpredictably!\r\n\r\nDUCK PIN\r\n\r\nInvented in 1904 in New England. Duck pin uses the nearly the same rules as 10 pin, but allows 3 rounds to knock over all the pins. The ball and pins are smaller making precision very important to score well!\r\n\r\nIRON PIN\r\n\r\nIron pin is the same as normal bowling but one random pin is much heavier than the others. Careful consideration has to be made on how to knock over the heavy pin while also clearing the normal ones.\r\n\r\nSHUFFLE BOWLING\r\n\r\nBowling on a shuffleboard table! Knock over the pins with a weighted puck.\r\n\r\nWEST COUNTY SKITTLES\r\n\r\nTraditional skittles game that has been played in British pubs for centuries.\r\n\r\nGalaxy Bowling has an option to purchase Candlepin, Duck Pin, Five Pin, Nine Pin, 100 pin, and Iron Pin variants. Ten pin, and spares mode are included free.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH3M6X1","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Grim Legends 2: Song Of The Dark Swan (Full)","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.55000.13510798884389502.2f263483-4e49-4591-b7de-6168dddd2a01.38eae029-46f6-4aa3-adf3-c5e415cccf6a","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"£5.79","Price":5.79,"AverageRating":4.6,"RatingsCount":"40","PackageFamilyNames":["ArtifexMundi.GrimLegends2SongoftheDarkSwanFull_xmkq9zz36w32m"],"ContentIds":["8dfa553c-ed87-5fd2-67e0-4779c2d992cf"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"FANTASTIC HIDDEN OBJECT PUZZLE ADVENTURE GAME FROM THE CREATORS OF ENIGMATIS AND GRIM LEGENDS!\r\nEmbark on a dangerous quest through mysterious ruins and magical woods in the second chapter of Grim Legends series.

Recall your childhood!\r\n\r\nLudo game that traces its lineage to 6th century India. Ludo is derived from game Pachisi. Ludo is also very similar to Spanish board game.\r\n\r\nLudo game has stayed popular throughout the ages, varying only a little in its game structure. This persevering game is now available for you to play in an all new modernized format, i.e. as a video game application.\r\n\r\nThe game is played between 2 to 4 players and you have the option of playing the game against the computer, against your friends, or even against people from around the world. The objective of the game is pretty straightforward; each player gets 4 tokens, these tokens must make a full turn of the board and then make it to the finish line.\r\n\r\nWhoever gets all four tokens to the end first is the winner. However, each move can only be made based on the number decided by casting a six-sided die, and each token can only move out of their home by casting a six. Additionally, the competition factor of the games is upped by the fact that while moving if another player’s token lands on the same square as your token, then your token will automatically be sent back home and you’ll need to roll a six again.\r\n\r\nLudo King is a game that was played by kings and now it can be enjoyed by you and your family and friends. While the game play might seem simple at first, the game is immensely enjoyable and challenging. You’ll be playing this one for hours and its fun for the whole family. Try to beat your opponents and compete for the highest scores on the leaderboards.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9MZTQDWGRCJN","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Onet Connect Classic","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.25128.13863661003126159.225f6b2e-8850-4a9a-9063-d5b5499c23e3.2238b96c-2876-4e12-bbba-af9978893a8c","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.39374.13863661003126159.225f6b2e-8850-4a9a-9063-d5b5499c23e3.3162926b-4c12-44e9-a701-6a93f596ac54","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":5.0,"RatingsCount":"19","PackageFamilyNames":["32954WSNCMCompany.OnetConnectClassic_4mfaww6ykbf20"],"ContentIds":["8717af42-23e1-2b5e-5954-586b4ccfd8c6","4af8cfc2-9a64-5e56-0a32-2ab96ecfe52c"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,HoloLens","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Try to earn as many points as you can in this cute Mahjong connect game!

Happy retro gaming!\r\n\r\nRocky Horror, The Fruit Machine can be played by touching the onscreen buttons (Or the corner game board icons, a real help for smaller screens) or by using a mouse-which covers most devices so happy retro gaming, all you need to provide is some real luck...\r\n\r\nTo add coins/credits to the fruit machine simply tap or click the red coin slot (Coin slot found at the top right of the fruit machine). Each tap/click of the coin slot will add four credits to the fruit machine, then just play the fruit machine like you normally would do. \r\n\r\nThe main features of Rocky Horror, The Fruit Machine include;\r\n\r\n-Trail Mystery Bonus Features-(When the trail is on number four you can select a random trail mystery bonus feature which may help you to either get a prize win or increase the trail number you are currently on, depending on the feature and most of the time they are a real help to the player. The mystery bonus features available include Random Rocket, Showskill, 3 Shot, Nudge, etc ...).\r\n\r\n-Trail Nudges, Nudge Gamble, Nudge Buster-(Trail nudges can be offered as a trail mystery bonus feature and are also offered randomly whilst playing the trail part of the fruit machine. When trail nudges are offered they are sometimes offered with a nudge gamble too and when you have trail nudges available you may use the nudge buster button to move all of the three main reels down one position at the cost of just one nudge, a real useful button indeed).\r\n\r\n-Hi-Lo Gamble-(When you get a prize win on the fruit machine or the trail number is nine or more, you will be offered an optional prize/trail hi-lo gamble. Here you can either collect your prize, gamble with a hi-lo or possibly exchange to the game board if available. If you gamble and lose, you will lose the gambled prize/trail, if you gamble and win though you will improve your prize/trail by one position/slot and if you have an exchange to game board offer, then that offer may improve too. If you are lucky and get to the top of the prize/trail board you will automatically win the trail jackpot repeater).\r\n\r\n-Exchange To Game Board-(When you get a prize win on the fruit machine or the trail number is nine or more, you may be offered an exchange to the game board. An exchange to the game board is offered when the tubes are lit in the tube slot next to the prize/trail amount you are currently on. When offered an exchange to game board amount, it will mirror the prize/trail slot you are currently on, the higher the slot, the better the game board exchange offer. The exchange offer may improve every time a hi-lo gamble is won, except on a trail jackpot repeater win).\r\n\r\n-Game Board/Tubes-(Once exchanged to the game board you can gamble and spin to try to add to or light up/activate the tubes or collect a tube if it’s active. The tubes consist of a cash tube, a grab tube, a nudge tube and a features tube which all offer different games and the higher the tube, the better. To select an active/lit up tube you can either press its corresponding button or press the corresponding corner icon on the game board. If any of the tubes reach the tube jackpot repeater slot you will automatically start the tube jackpot repeater game).\r\n\r\nThere are many more features like the board mystery bonus games, tile games, tube games/features, holds, trail holds, real fun and too many to list and explain in detail. The game also has retro sound effects, all in all, a lot of real retro fun in one retro fruit machine-happy retro gaming!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRD26R5","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Cross Word Guess","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.26455.9007199267164216.15c44e14-cbb2-428a-a72d-ccc424f9a41f.51c3608a-4c3a-4aed-b238-922740430049","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#993300","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.58629.9007199267164216.eb4fc268-03bf-4ea4-82d4-a91d8617c7ce.5ca94943-e492-46b4-9580-cea53d7b62ed","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#993300","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"£1.69","Price":1.69,"AverageRating":3.0,"RatingsCount":"6","PackageFamilyNames":["20000AppBest.CrosswordPuzzle_rvkrnsv9b4qzc"],"ContentIds":["281b1ea1-fa89-a9c4-c05a-0f2c6fda44af"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Crossword Puzzle is a casual crossword and crossnumber puzzle for the entire family.\r\n\r\nThis educational game will test your vocabulary, accept this challenge and discover an easy and fun way to learn new words and general knowledge.\r\n\r\nGet thousands of crossword puzzles of every level to play.\r\n\r\nEnjoy it.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NFPQMZ0NQ4J","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Find The Hidden Objects","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.52114.13590719307799303.deaad7f2-5760-4f97-9566-e4c790462281.ba7d760f-d7c6-4d27-93d6-f677caef0a14","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.39270.13590719307799303.deaad7f2-5760-4f97-9566-e4c790462281.b81a8094-117a-412a-92a8-9cc10af2763d","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.20759.13590719307799303.deaad7f2-5760-4f97-9566-e4c790462281.05b99116-b683-4454-8632-f71b9e9974fe","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"£1.49","Price":1.49,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["61643PlayEverydayGames.FindTheHiddenObjects_fvk8tmxh6cs7a"],"ContentIds":["771774a2-2ba0-17cd-9fe6-86472b1a5eaa","0f375170-e19c-4914-ad06-e10024ac11c3"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"  ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,HoloLens,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Can you Find all the Hidden Toys?\r\n\r\nThe game principle is simple: Find a series of Mystery Toys hidden objects in a scene!\r\nHidden Objects Mystery Toys is a challenging puzzle game to test hidden power of you brain and visual skills in a time constrained game play.\r\n\r\nMystery Toys Hidden Objects is a free game about to test your strategy, you will be challenged like never before!

New story filled with magic, treachery and brave feats. Are you ready? \r\nThe story of the game starts in the kingdom of old Viking king Arnar. Turns out, he was cursed by a vicious dwarf. Not just a dwarf, but Loki (the Scandinavian god of mischief) himself. The reason was simple – a precious ring. Arnar found it and refused to sell it. Many years later, the curse got through to him. This is where the action begins. Arnar gives his younger son a mission to find a dwarf and return the ring. \r\nThe Vikings sailed to the setting sun for many days, until the storm scattered their drakkar on the shores of some island. They were lucky, it was the island they were looking for. Travel with Ingolf along the picturesque lands, help the locals solve their problems, make friends with a wise Druid and, most importantly, find Loki to deliver the Viking king from the curse of the ring! \r\n\r\nJOIN US! \r\n\r\nEnjoy Realore Games at: http://www.realore.com \r\nFollow us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/RealoreGame \r\nFollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/RealoreGames \r\nPrivacy Policy: http://www.realore.com/appprivacypolicy.php","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRFJCFZ","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Kids Dinosaur Rex Jigsaw Puzzles - educational shape and matching children's game","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.45252.9007199266251544.d897a371-39b3-4860-b919-15a376b9e607.453c480c-aa5a-4232-8b15-7c074c34d82c","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.36104.9007199266251544.0a4f0f5e-ccdf-4b56-b8d6-86cf12c12e44.bd7f7660-cf7a-403a-b0ff-9fd458560e51","Height":210,"Width":210,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.39070.9007199266251544.d814d534-7976-4012-b771-625d674b11b0.47336fc5-7eca-476b-8a2b-c96bbc8a24e0","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.10974.9007199266251544.d5269a8c-2430-4ded-acca-7b25db71c937.db83c54d-0daa-4740-8a75-6234fadaaa94","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.4153.9007199266251544.96a37f09-addb-4296-bc42-8e92940fde23.c8fe84cf-330f-49be-a18b-7773c0252000","Height":210,"Width":434,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.41824.9007199266251544.d59d7d0f-65f4-4c1a-80d0-f6850f490372.2d68b29e-9af9-4874-bc91-037e5f4e2ae3","Height":270,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.18697.9007199266251544.ebe0feeb-4b41-47f9-afc1-a052c944386a.86109428-ed23-4849-b183-dc703f17a1c9","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.35724.9007199266251544.456bbf53-b3b0-4c81-ba91-8a368c2a2d2d.508477da-395a-492a-8d5e-1b942e196428","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.13713.9007199266251544.99b998f3-3327-4aa4-a129-0210beebfdbb.8063ac8b-e170-4311-9bb5-40469ffbf3a4","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":3.5,"RatingsCount":"8","PackageFamilyNames":["EspacePtyLtd.KidsDinosaurJigsawPuzzles-educational_38khqxevzecjw"],"ContentIds":["556c1b16-0282-e20d-2b68-f6cc74e5db40","e7b4be6f-63c4-1ca4-a44b-85b247c46c87"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Complete jigsaw puzzles of your favorite dinosaurs and learn how to pronounce each of their names in English. \r\n\r\nThis educational and fun set of games helps young children learn matching skills while developing their hand eye coordination and puzzle solving skills.

generated dungeon with lots of dangers at every corner.\r\n\r\nJoin a brave hero in a deadly quest\r\n\r\nAs the story goes, the dreadful Lord Slyn has been pillaging and looting the hard working people of Rend for quite some time and no one has ever managed to put an end to his evil reign.\r\n\r\nAs one of the few mighty heroes of the realm, you've been tasked to enter Lord Slyn's dungeon and kill him to stop all the suffering he's caused bringing peace to the entire land.\r\n\r\nAs easy as it may sound, this will prove to be one of the most dangerous challenges you've ever encountered, and you'll have to use your wits to hope that you'll get out alive. Moreover, once you manage to reach the bottom level of the dungeon and slay Lord Slyn, you'll also have to fight your way and survive the road back to the surface.\r\n\r\nMultiple player classes with awesome abilities\r\n\r\nBefore starting your quest you will have to choose one of the five possible hero classes: fighter, mage, paladin, priest, and ranger.\r\n\r\nEach of these classes come with unique strengths and weaknesses that will require a different approach when confronting the enemies from the dungeon.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, as most rogulike games, death is final so advance carefully and engage in battles only when you're sure you can come out victorious or you'll have to start the adventure from the very beginning.\r\n\r\nBesides monsters, the dungeon is also the place where you will find lots of weapons, equipment and consumables with different properties. While some can give you an instant boost to your skills, other can be cursed and besides their negative effects will bind to your hero needing you to remove their curse if you want to get rid of them.\r\n\r\nSpell books, potions, and magic wands can also be found during your adventure but, will require identification scrolls if you don't want to risk casting a curse on yourself or drinking a deadly potion.\r\n\r\nThe game packs lots of content regarding weapons, equipment, and other consumables which combined with the random dungeon generator, makes it deliver a completely unique experience each time you play it.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NSGBJ8CZCVC","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Farm Frenzy Town Simulator","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.38734.14364225526325356.cc1c0b4c-30b3-491f-a924-9681b69511cb.c0c2a283-7bf9-44bc-b14b-195bbf49bf91","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#333333","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.10684.14364225526325356.cc1c0b4c-30b3-491f-a924-9681b69511cb.08d92471-ba66-490c-9cdc-ae52b1236d47","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#333333","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.43513.14364225526325356.cc1c0b4c-30b3-491f-a924-9681b69511cb.83f844b2-3b3d-46b1-8425-a7e41084a256","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#333333","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.50750.14364225526325356.cc1c0b4c-30b3-491f-a924-9681b69511cb.488ca65d-6d56-4d3b-b6a7-79843317f52f","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#333333","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"£1.69","Price":1.69,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["30299ZJC.FarmHayDayTownship_rcfkh73117q02"],"ContentIds":["2734177e-4978-1d87-3beb-9472c6e22c0a","4f51484a-e083-76e9-b4a0-a42b2d870345"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"A legendary game about farming. \r\n\r\nExplore fascinating farm, start playing, move to a country and learn how to manage a farm in a real fury. \r\n\r\nGrow plants, feed animals, grab laid eggs and follow instructions.

Restore the balance between Light and Darkness! Build towers and traps using technologies of Orcs, Goblins and Necromancers.\r\nShow your tactical skills combining various towers' effects and using terrain features. Protect the stronghold of the Dark Forces from the onslaught of hostile armies of Light!\r\n\r\nNOTICE: If you have problems running the game please contact us (and please specify your device model): wp7.smartpixgames@gmail.com\r\nFAQ: http://www.smartpixgames.com/faq.php#p10\r\nPromo video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRz9-Zf0flk\r\n\r\nIn the full version of Myth Defense: Dark Forces:\r\n- 4 maps + random map in battle mode\r\n- campaign: 10 + 50 missions and 2 modes to pass it: Normal and Heroic\r\n- achievements, increasing amount of Glory Points for mission\r\n- different skills improvement \r\n- 22 types of towers and 3 types of traps in 3 technological branches (Orcs, Necromancers, Goblins)\r\n- special features of monsters and towers\r\n- runes to make towers stronger, and Alchemy to create runes\r\n- terrain features: difficult terrain, moving platforms, etc.\r\n- 40 levels of hardness. The higher the level, the greater the reward\r\n- multilingual interface\r\n- original panoramic sound and music\r\n- additional DLC maps and campaigns with new enemies and towers\r\n- online worldwide leaderboards\r\n\r\nWe hope that Light Forces commanders, who loved the first part of Myth Defense, will be pleasantly surprised by the innovations in this part:\r\n• Enemies are now divided into classes: Live, Machine and Magic. Some towers affects only units of one class.\r\n• Moving platforms on the battlefield where you can build towers. Platform with a tower will move as close as possible to enemy units and attack them.\r\n• Some units (Dwarf and Paladin) wear armor. Armor absorbs 80% of low physical damage. Armor threshold is shown in the unit description which you can see by tapping on an enemy unit on the field. If tower causes more physical damage than the armor threshold, the armor breaks down and the unit gets full damage value. Armor doesn't protect units from other types of damage (fire , magic, etc)\r\n• Several fundamentally new towers:\r\n  - Fear Tower: scares enemy units, forcing them to run away from the tower for a while. One enemy can be scared only once (though some units are fearless).\r\n  - Cursed Tower: normally it shoots causing a base damage but can be charged with coins to temporarily multiply its power. If the health of the enemy unit does not exceed the base damage, the tower will kill it without spending extra-points. If the unit is strong tower will try to kill it, spending no more than enough extra-points.\r\n  - Jet Mace: shoots with a large spiked ball horizontally or vertically. It strikes several enemy units losing some destructive power each time. The ball continues to fly until it loses all the energy.\r\n  - Radioactive towers (Uranium and Plutonium): do not shoot, but continuously irradiates all units within damage radius. Golems and infected (by Plague or Poison Spider Tower) units are vulnerable to radiation.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"}],"Title":"Most popular
