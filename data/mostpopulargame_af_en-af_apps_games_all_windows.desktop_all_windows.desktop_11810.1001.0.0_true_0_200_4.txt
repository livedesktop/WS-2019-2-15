A drift is when a driver performs a controlled slide through corners while adhering to the racing line. Drifting involves fast cars, super skilled drivers and hardcore fans.\r\n\r\nIt’s a combination of driving skill, style and showmanship. It’s all about loss of the rear wheel traction while keeping the race car in total control. Drifting is so popular because it brings all the best aspects of motor sports into one package. Highly skilled drivers control a high powered street car past its limit, sideways at high speed, burning rubber. It can’t get any better!\r\n____________________________________\r\n\r\nSUPPORT: http://en.ratrodstudio.com/support/ \r\nVISIT US: http://ratrodstudio.com\r\nFOLLOW US:

Use your cunning to kill or tame the primeval creatures roaming the land, and encounter other players to survive, dominate... and escape! \r\n\r\nTAME, TRAIN, BREED & RIDE DINOSAURS, IN A LIVING ECOSYSTEM\r\nOver 50 creatures can be tamed using a challenging subdue-&-protect process. Weaken a feral creature to knock it out, and then nursing it to health. Once tamed, you can issue commands to your Pet, which it may follow depending on how well you’ve tamed and trained it. Pets continue to level-up and consume food, and carry Inventory and Equipment.  Fly a Pteranodon over the mountains, race through the jungle with a pack of Raptors, or chase down prey on a T-Rex! Experience a dynamic ecosystem with its own predator & prey hierarchies. Breed Pets through successive generations to generate the best traits. Or put more simply, breed & raise Dino Babies!\r\n\r\nFOOD, WATER, TEMPERATURE AND WEATHER\r\nEat and drink to survive, with different foods having different nutritional values (including human meat!). All actions drain food and water, and long-distance travel is draining. Inventory weight slows you down, and the day/night cycle and weather alter the environment. Craft clothing, build shelter, and use fire to protect yourself against damage & the elements.\r\n\r\nHARVEST, CRAFT, AND PAINT ITEMS\r\nHarvest trees, ore, and more to become a master crafter. Use your hands, a Smithy, or a Fabricator to craft increasingly complex and powerful gear. Build a massive base using modular pieces--ranging from Thatch, to Wood, to Stone, to Metal. Customize your base by painting it and placing signs that you can actually draw on. Weapons, clothing, & armor gear can also be painted to express your own visual style.\r\n\r\nSUMMON THE ULTIMATE LIFE FORMS\r\nBring rare items to special Summon locations to awaken the ARK’s mythical creatures, who arrive ready for battle. These monstrosities provide an end-game goal for the most experienced Tribes and their Pets, and yield valuable items if they are defeated.\r\n\r\nRPG STATISTICS\r\nLevel-Up your survivor by gaining experience through in-game actions to learn new crafting Engrams, or find higher level item Blueprints in the most dangerous parts of the ARK. Customize the look of your character with a complex character creation system.\r\n\r\nHARDCORE MECHANICS\r\nItems have durability and wear out with use if not repaired. When you leave the game, your character remains “sleeping” in the persistent world. Your inventory also exists in the persistent world, vulnerable to theft. Death means permanent loss, and you can even enslave other players for your own purposes.\r\n\r\nLARGE WORLD PERSISTENCE\r\nOn the 70+ player servers, your character, everything you built, and your pets stay in-game even when you leave. Special themed events will occur in the world with corresponding limited-run items!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH5WMKM","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Halo Wars 2","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.7936.13510798886375954.4688894c-dc6a-463c-8168-663e9c98fa5b.f4f639b4-e921-41f7-b7d7-68cbdace89c9","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.6988.13510798886375954.7fab3417-408f-452b-bb10-612182e7a5ee.5708d7dd-59ab-411a-b732-5de746c6ee4c","Height":2160,"Width":2160,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.53461.13510798886375954.2bd17aeb-ccc6-4036-989d-32d2eba17cb4.5d2d8045-b64c-414b-be60-78bc5c7e85f2","Height":2160,"Width":1440,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"StrikethroughPrice":"","DisplayPrice":"","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["Microsoft.HoganThreshold_8wekyb3d8bbwe"],"ContentIds":["04066b8e-ddd0-35b6-05f1-99f5ba086a2a"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"It’s the Halo experience you’ve dreamed of – controlling entire armies of Marines, Warthogs, Scorpion tanks, and Spartans on the battlefield from the Commander’s point of view.

How? You blow at them with more bubbles, and when three or more of the same color come together, they all explode. Just tap at where you want the next bubble to go.\r\nThe more bubbles blow up at one tap, the increasingly more points you gain (six ones at one tap is better tan two three-bubble taps). Besides, those bubbles that fell apart from the rest will explode too. It is well worth trying to arrange such avalanches, as they will give you ten times more points than ordinary bursts.\r\nAnother important rule to know is that the borders are like mirrors. If you shoot a bubble towards an exposed border, it will not stick to the border but will bounce right back like a stream of light against a mirror. This feature becomes really handful when the center of your board is filled up with and you need to shoot some bubbles on the sidebars.\r\nIf your tap fails to detonate any bubbles, you get a foul, and when there are several fouls, one or two new line of bubbles appears at the top. The number of misfires allowed before bubbles will advance again, is shown by the number of silver ball in the left bottom corner.\r\nThe game is over when you clean all the bubbles off and your score doubles, or bubbles move all the way down on you.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9N8GZBNSQ977","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Happy Cafe","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.32931.14049822462209194.cf207702-66e8-4695-8818-372a750809d9.5fa23807-0bde-42f1-99f0-edf4985baef9","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.10917.14049822462209194.5d172334-e0ca-4518-bb13-7a90924a9c00.9a3cc411-7159-4a7a-8b36-994ea456297d","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.32931.14049822462209194.cf207702-66e8-4695-8818-372a750809d9.5fa23807-0bde-42f1-99f0-edf4985baef9","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["27182KingdomEntertainment.HappyCafe_cpmqwwcbvdks4"],"ContentIds":["d42059f9-c6cd-dfc9-17f4-389f3a883a70","88ff90e9-be86-e3df-9b90-6e3b37a2a7f2"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Run the greatest pizza shop in town!

It can be played between two players, or a single person can play against the computer. In each turn, a player plays a disc which converts discs belonging to the opponent to the player's own color.

The goal is to end the game such that you have larger number of discs on the board compared to your opponent.

The interactive objects can be used for learning landing and precise model control. \r\n\r\nIn addition to the fixed point camera that represents the RC pilot point of view, we have included follow up camera that allows for walking behind the model.

This is done by surrounding it, either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally (or a combination of all three). When this occurs, the opponent's discs that you have surround become yours.\r\n* If one player cannot make a valid move, the player must pass and the other player plays again.\r\n* The game is over when the entire board is filled or when no side can make a valid move.\r\n* The winner of the game is the one with the most discs when the game is over.\r\n\r\nNOTES: Ultima Reversi has an \"Auto Pass\" feature that automatically passes your turn if you have no other move available and must

Take control of a whole country, like the USA, Germany, France, Russia, or Austria. Change laws, taxes and budgets based on real world statistics and data, and see what happens.\r\n\r\nThe game simulates a whole country: Population, debt, GDP, economic growth, unemployment, crime, life expectancy, birth rate, mortality rate, state of the infrastructure and so on. The player can adjust budgets, taxes, laws, and see what the outcome is. \r\n\r\nReal World Data\r\n\r\nThe game is running on real-world data. Meaning everything is based on real values: If you play as the USA, the debt, income, expenditures, crime rate, unemployment rate, etc. you start with is based on the actual, real values of the USA. For example if you lower a tax rate, you'll see what the simulation calculates as new values afterwards, in dollars, people, crimes per 100.000, interest rate, life expectancy in years, and similar.\r\n\r\nGameplay\r\n\r\nThere are goals to fulfill, like decreasing the crime rate or achieving a certain public health or education rating, but it is already interesting to try to tamper with the various options alone: What happens if you lower the minimum wage? What if you change the length of maternity leave? Or the retirement age? You can also do more serious changes like introducing censorship laws, compulsory military service, cash bans, or universal basic income.\r\n\r\nThere are military options, so you can start a war with any country in the world, and adjust its operation mode while the conflict is active. But be sure not to let it run out of control.

It is one of the best known board games of all-time.\r\n\r\nThe classic fast-trading property game features tokens from the 1930s all the way to the 2000s, with a beautiful game board and cards, the game takes you back to when it all began, but you still have to build your houses and hotels and see if you can bankrupt everyone else. The jet-set gameplay will be epic as you race around the world to visit the world’s most exciting places and buy locations.\r\n\r\nOnopoly is also known popularly called Business Board Game, The Landlord's Game and Finance\r\n\r\nOnopoly is a great game for 2 - 6 players. It is a board game where players roll two six-sided dice to move around the game board, buying and trading properties, and develop them with houses and hotels. Players collect rent from their opponents, with the goal being to drive them into bankruptcy. \r\n\r\nMoney can also be gained or lost through Chance and Community Chest cards, and tax squares; players can end up in jail, which they cannot move from until they have met one of several conditions. There are other places on the board which can not be bought, but instead require the player to draw a card and perform the action on the card, pay taxes, collect income, or even go to jail.\r\n\r\nPlay against the computer, against your friends in Local mode or with Thousands of Onopoly players around the world in Online Multiplayer Mode.\r\n\r\nYou can also create Private Rooms and invite your friends to play in Play with Friends Mode.\r\n\r\nOnopoly is a simple game: you start off with some money, and your goal is to be the last player standing with money. The way you win in Monopoly is by collecting rents on property, or cash flow.\r\n\r\nOnopoly brilliantly combines both strategy and chance. It gets stressful and exciting, especially when things get closer to the endgame. \r\n\r\nYou better keep an eye on your money, because you never know when the dice will land you with a massive rent bill to pay. Sometimes staying in jail can be the safest place to be, but only after your properties are primed to make you money.\r\n\r\nYou’ve got to buy, sell and negotiate to win. Everyone loves the timeless game-play of Onopoly. \r\n\r\nTry to win the onopoly game by buying all the property and collecting as much money as possible. \r\nWill you be able to defeat your opponents? \r\n\r\nDownload Onopoly for free!!\r\n\r\n◆◆◆◆ Onopoly Features◆◆◆◆\r\n\r\n✔ Create Private Room and Invite Friends and Family\r\n✔ True multiplayer where you can play with real people online in online multiplayer mode.\r\n✔ Adaptable intelligence with smart AI when playing against computer\r\n✔ Play with players across the world\r\n✔ 2, 3,4,5 or 6 Player Mode \r\n✔ Play with Local Multiplayer\r\n \r\nPlease don't forget to Rate and Review Onopoly! \r\n\r\nYour Reviews Matter!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH16NXT","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Pirates of Everseas","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.42317.13510798882431062.e5db4b54-e08a-4f3e-8d32-c484889ea537.747ca3b4-a26f-4a08-bde3-a3bb8a6da033","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.59112.13510798882431062.abb26fed-e9c6-4bab-abaf-50f8de2a00e3.118443ad-2380-44d7-818c-3ed1ceb5d60c","Height":225,"Width":225,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.26178.13510798882431062.6dd26c2b-ca20-4568-892c-5263f5b3ec2b.d31f7dc7-300b-4079-8f46-9be3f2c6456f","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.37489.13510798882431062.5bf65801-abd1-4dcf-81b5-8da3387ff6f3.adcec3a8-be9b-4be2-a212-a8ef220108f7","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.10217.13510798882431062.a8d68a27-3657-4d56-ae75-d01be9d1d9fa.9fc8b277-a1af-4c0e-bcab-2f72bfbbf876","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.40160.13510798882431062.958c9745-09ca-47c1-aa40-c53c31fd2df4.5c15b890-f9fe-4a99-90b3-e42af36b20bf","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.26094.13510798882431062.875665be-6028-4304-a6d1-ce4f5af4ba6d.cf3ac36a-e4a5-43d6-b4f5-c1924097a798","Height":225,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.47135.13510798882431062.71ca0132-9fa8-42f4-8f7c-15bfdc58723c.89b0ada0-0a39-43d8-811d-9d59facbbb8d","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.57192.13510798882431062.24ed7e21-d909-4821-95ae-9f36de59cab8.3617d14f-d8d5-4515-becd-b78b8f043e07","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["D613A6F8.PiratesofEverseas_btmtanmd0c15y"],"ContentIds":["ae4f28e5-b97d-4f48-ffcf-ee622d66029b","f6fe1184-60ff-4a83-ca57-0cf02d354cef"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Ahoy, Captain!

legions of enemies attack from all sides. The powerful domain of the kingdom attracts enemies of all kinds, each more dangerous and devastating to the realm's armies than the last. \r\n\r\nThe king's reign has been threatened, and his personal sorcerer believes he has come up with a way to pull on ancient magic to ensure protection of castle and king, but something terrible and unexpected occurred during the spell and now a dark and mysterious force now looms large over the lands. It is only a matter of time before the day of reckoning descends over the nations and heralds the realms to a new age and dominate empire. \r\n\r\nCenturies of Feuding...\r\nThey'd inherited the feud from their fathers and couldn't recall the original cause. Perhaps they knew not who started it or why, but they certainly knew who would end it and how. Blinking up at the glaring light, the dark centers of the warrior's blazing eyes seemed to sear the air around the fierce brute. The magician stood back- pleased, yet on edge at what to expect. The spell was complete. The Druid Warlord of legend was born, and he was ready to go to war for the people of Komkaria. The Warlord lurched upright, and the glint of a candlelight flashed off his blade as it swung viciously through the air. \"Traitor!\" the Warlord growled. As the blade found its mark, and the blood gurgled up in the throat of the magician, he realized the one fatal flaw in his spell...\r\n\r\nGive it Your Best Shot...\r\nFight your way against dozens of ultimate foes as you guard the mighty powers of this impressive temple of war. The forceful soul of the guardian spirit is potent within these walls, but whose side does he champion? Wield magic weapons and powers as you confront the terror of the lands and conquer the people's greatest fears from legends lost.\r\n\r\nGame Features:\r\n\r\n*Discover epic pixel weapons \r\n*Search the temples for amazing perks \r\n*Fight barbarians hand-to-hand \r\n*Real-time map with sky view alerts \r\n*Increasingly difficult survival challenge\r\n*Navigate three intense FPS
