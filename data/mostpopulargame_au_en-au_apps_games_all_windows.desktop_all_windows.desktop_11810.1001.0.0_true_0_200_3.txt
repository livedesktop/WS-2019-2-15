The computer game was originally created by Brodie Lockard in 1981 and named Mah-Jongg after the game that uses the same tiles for play. Lockard claims that it was based on a centuries-old Chinese game called \"the Turtle\". However, it was not until Activision released Shanghai in 1986 for the Macintosh and Apple IIgs that the game gathered momentum. A version of this game was also included in the Microsoft Entertainment Pack for Windows 3.x in 1990 and went by the name Taipei. It was subsequently included in the Best of Windows Entertainment Pack. Premium editions of the Windows Vista operating system and Windows 7 include a version of the game known as Mahjong Titans. \r\nAs any other successful game, millions of clones have been created on all possible platforms. So why should you give our version a try? We tried to recreate all the fun of original game with 60 different layouts in a tiny download package. \r\nA tile that can be moved left or right without disturbing other tiles is said to be exposed. Exposed pairs of identical tiles (Flower and Seasons tiles in the same group being considered identical) are removed from the layout one at a time, gradually exposing the lower layers to play. The aim of the game is to clear the layout by pairing up all the tiles. The game is finished when either the layout is empty, or there are no exposed pairs remaining.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDL22C","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Mirror Mysteries","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.20649.9007199266412856.b1c7758c-88c3-448a-9b9a-d1d0af0556d7.cf13c028-dd65-4e8f-b75c-b5c166c36e9f","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#145251","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.45924.9007199266412856.503b796d-1168-4dcf-af29-6a1bbbe8e5ea.0ffbf9fc-1cb6-4ddc-975e-1d8974293019","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#145251","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":3.6,"RatingsCount":"5","PackageFamilyNames":["GogiiGames.MirrorMysteries_h0jt470c3ph82"],"ContentIds":["0eace347-ac0b-b970-868a-61568a022532"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Free Trial Version: A young family stops at an abandoned old house for a picnic and as the mother closes her eyes to enjoy the sun, she hears a door slam, the kids!

That’s why we have developed Multiplication Dragons, to provide new, fun ways to engage with multiplication that stimulate ease of memorization and improved recall. We all know how difficult it is to remember things without using the proper tools, and Multiplication Dragons provides just that. Our brightly colored, unique, three-dimensional environments provide visual and auditory spaces in which children can learn by associating multiplication questions with a rhyme, an in-game location, and the dragon that asks the question.\r\n\r\nMultiplication Dragons helps increase memorization and ease of recall using two memory devices that reinforce each other: rhyme and the memory palace (a.k.a. the method of loci). It will introduce your child to the world of multiplication using 3D animated dragons that guide them through 12 different environments, including a lagoon, a Halloween inspired level, a mountain, caves, a winter setting, and more! Each of the 144 questions is asked by one of our many dragons, stationed in various locations and levels throughout the game. Questions are asked using a phrase that both rhymes with the answer, and relates to the particular surroundings of the level currently being played. Multiplication questions also appear onscreen and are read aloud, a design feature used to help young readers and those experiencing difficulty reading, and to provide our dragons with a bit of extra personality. \r\n\r\nWe draw on rhyme because it has been used in various ways and has stood the test of time as a mnemonic device. After all, how many times has the age-old “thirty days has September, April, June, and November” rhyme helped you to recall the number of days in a month? It has been used for generations, and proven its success over and over again. Our second memory device, the memory palace, is one of the oldest and most successful tools in the book! This method goes back to the ancient Greeks, and involves imagining a familiar environment (like your home) and associating the things to be remembered with particular areas or aspects of that environment.  The visual and spatial qualities of this form provide additional contact points that aid in the creation of cognitive associations with the thing that we want to remember. This creates more access routes for our brains to get at the desired information, and thus increases ease of recall. By using both of these methods together we have increased these possible cognitive associations even further, while providing you and your child with hours of fun!\r\n\r\nChildren will earn 1-3 stars based on the amount of correct answers given on a level, giving them the opportunity to return to a level and break their current score. They will also get an encouraging cheer from our dragons for each right or wrong answer, and unlock new levels by successfully completing a timetable level. They can also make use of an added visual cue by reviewing the timetable itself, and test recall by attempting quiz mode. Here, your child must answer questions without the rhymes, and in random order, simulating a school math test. And unlike other games that offer one free level and then charge you for the remaining eleven, we ask for one payment which includes access to all twelve levels, quiz mode, and timetable mode.\r\n\r\nMultiplication Dragons provides your child with a whole world of exploration that introduces, reinforces, and tests multiplication skills, in a mode that feels like play. It’s time exchange the mechanical repetition of rote learning for techniques that make memorization easy and fun. Add some good-times to your tables, with Multiplication Dragons!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH6CH07","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Evo Explores","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.28667.13510798886612620.29d00bc0-2503-45b0-bef0-ec6601b30850.a5c086ea-2503-4c99-9abd-746ad9544e74","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.64337.13510798886612620.e3973445-0ad6-4eca-b883-4b8197b1d8d6.79ccfef3-5959-4de2-a15c-97ea978dcb30","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.38204.13510798886612620.3b2a3777-fc74-44a0-bcbe-12bb9a2fabbf.3246c000-d49b-4a38-b5b7-cae492ddc1bb","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.22016.13510798886612620.5f406b5e-5805-4591-8691-b4e45b0c9985.9bcbe18f-42c8-4b8f-8ddb-2db3920192e6","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"AU$2.95","Price":2.95,"AverageRating":4.7,"RatingsCount":"7","PackageFamilyNames":["32363StampedeGames.EvoExplores_ssg7zgmzztv24"],"ContentIds":["fc74df49-252f-b628-0593-64be913ff25c","2d77e0a2-8d2b-7411-559e-a89d9224887e"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"  ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,HoloLens,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"• In Evo Explores you should trust your eyes.

If you make a mistake, simply tap the Undo button. Zoom in and out by pinching the screen and pan the view using a two finger drag. \r\n\r\nWhile testing, you can see how the strain is distributed across your design. Areas that are under immense strain are colored bright red, while other areas are colored green. This allows you to find and fix problem areas in your design. \r\n\r\nThe finger test lets you use your finger to push and pull on your design.

New graphics! We will continue updating the game. Thank you for your support of independent game developers! \r\n\r\nUse your periscope to target and destroy enemy ships. Join our big submarine patrol team. Be on our submarine! \r\n\r\nLegend says: The year was 1982. Argentina invaded the Falklands and other British territories in the South Atlantic. The British sent an expeditionary force to retake the islands. \r\n\r\nIn Submarine Patrol, you will relive this era as a leader of a submarine that patrols the islands and destroys enemy battleships.   \r\n\r\nTarget well before you shoot! Remember, you have a limited number of torpedoes on board. You cannot immediately fire one torpedo after another. \r\n\r\nIt takes 2-3 seconds to prepare the next torpedo. Injured ships, depending on the amount of damage, may reduce their speed and move slower. \r\n\r\nDepending on the ship type, you can hit it 1 to 4 times before it is completely destroyed. You have 10 levels to complete. If you do well you will be promoted to commander, captain, or even an admiral. The quality of shooting is determined by your score. You score with every successful shot and you are fined with every missed torpedo.  \r\n\r\nPlease, check our website for tips and tricks on the game here: http://pepper-games.com","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDLFW1","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Drag Racing 3D","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.31372.9007199266414728.19fe3d7c-eaac-47ec-96c7-795f82c530d5.71aa4a3a-87c0-4114-9d17-174a54564105","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"AU$1.45","Price":1.45,"AverageRating":4.8,"RatingsCount":"12","PackageFamilyNames":["46565REVOLUTIONFIST.DragRacing3D_zx5e914mrp7t8"],"ContentIds":["6927314d-c9a2-00e8-0af4-f34f93c65794","87034990-8221-c7c9-71f5-df34626e97ea"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"EXCITING RACING!\r\nIt is the game, where you can race through dark streets. \r\nDrag Racing 3D © is exciting night street races.

By combining two men you can create a single more powerful man who is able to kill weaker men. The twist to the game is that the more powerful a man that you create is, the more expensive he is to maintain. Men cannot be un-bought so you must tread a fine line between building up your forces and not being rashly ambitious.

How do they know an opponent has a singleton king? It seems like they can see the opponents' cards, or read their minds! Nothing could be further from the truth!\r\nBy logically analyzing all of the available information from the bidding and playing of the cards, the correct way to play a hand presents itself. The hands in this app do not contain complicated distributions or complex squeeze situations. On the contrary.\r\nWith help from questions Marty asks, thinking logically and reasoning correctly will become second nature. You will reap the rewards at the bridge table and have your opponents asking how you knew the queen was a singleton or that the suit split 4-0.\r\nThis app contains 57 hands where you are declarer and 52 hands where you are defending. All of the hands have expert comments from Marty Bergen. \r\n\r\nWhen playing the deals, you will feel as if Marty Bergen is looking over your shoulder and giving you advice and tips to help you find the best way to play the hand.\r\n\r\nThis app is perfect for the bridge player who wants to improve his/her playing skills. When you are playing the deal but don’t play perfectly, you will get a message explanation what you should have done. You also have the option to let the program ask you questions about the play. Every bridge player should ask these questions themselves before playing a card. By answering the questions  you will learn the best approach. Once you are used to asking yourself these type of questions, you will have made a big step in improving your play and becoming a better opponent.\r\nThe bidding system is based on Standard American. However, the auction is always provided for you so this program is appropriate for all players.\r\n\r\nTo use the app, no internet connection is needed.\r\n\r\nAbout Marty Bergen\r\nMarty is a U.S. bridge teacher/player/author.  He is a ten-time national champion and ACBL Grand Life Master and World Bridge Federation World International Master. He retired from active competition in 1993 to concentrate on teaching and writing. He was recently voted to be the 22 most influential person in the history of bridge. \r\nMarty has been a columnist in the monthly ACBL Bridge Bulletin since 1976. He has also written 69 bridge books; two of which won the ABTA Bridge Book of the Year award.

It is fundamentally different from most solitaire games in that very few hands are unsolvable. Although software implementations vary, most versions label the hands with a number (derived from the random number seed used to generate the hand).\r\n\r\nA version of FreeCell was created by Microsoft for release with the Windows operating system.\r\n\r\nFreeCell solitaire is one kinds of funny solitaire card game, but it's not like other solitaires. You need no luck to win, only skill is required. All cards are opened from the start and the deal has the solution, you can win, think and move wisely. \r\n\r\nKey Features: \r\n- deals with different difficulty \r\n- every completed deal has score \r\n- customizable background and card \r\n- magnetic card movement \r\n- supermove: multiple card dragging \r\n- drag or tap to move \r\n- undo option \r\n- optimized battery usage for very long gameplay \r\n\r\nRules\r\nConstruction and layout\r\nOne standard 52-card deck is used.\r\nThere are four open cells and four open foundations. Some alternate rules use between one to ten cells.\r\nCards are dealt into eight cascades, four of which comprise seven cards and four of which comprise six. Some alternate rules will use between four to ten cascades.\r\n\r\nBuilding during play\r\nThe top card of each cascade begins a tableau.\r\nTableaux must be built down by alternating colors.\r\nFoundations are built up by suit.\r\n\r\nMoves\r\nAny cell card or top card of any cascade may be moved to build on a tableau, or moved to an empty cell, an empty cascade, or its foundation.\r\nComplete or partial tableaus may be moved to build on existing tableaus, or moved to empty cascades, by recursively placing and removing cards through intermediate locations. Computer implementations often show this motion, but players using physical decks typically move the tableau at once.\r\n\r\nVictory\r\nThe game is won after all cards are moved to their foundation piles.\r\nVarious computer versions of Freecell occasionally deal unsolvable games.\r\n\r\n\r\nHistory\r\nOne of the oldest ancestors of FreeCell is Eight Off. In the June 1968 edition of Scientific American, Martin Gardner described in his \"Mathematical Games\" column a game by C. L. Baker that is similar to FreeCell, except that cards on the tableau are built by suit rather than by alternate colors. Gardner wrote, \"The game was taught to Baker by his father, who in turn learned it from an Englishman during the 1920s.\" This variant is now called Baker's Game. FreeCell's origins may date back even further to 1945 and a Scandinavian game called Napoleon in St. Helena (not the game Napoleon at St. Helena, also known as Forty Thieves).\r\n\r\nPaul Alfille changed Baker's Game by making cards build according to alternate colors, thus creating FreeCell. He implemented the first computerised version of it in the TUTOR programming language for the PLATO educational computer system in 1978. Alfille was able to display easily recognizable graphical images of playing cards on the 512 * 512 monochrome display on the PLATO systems.\r\n\r\nThis original FreeCell environment allowed games with 4–10 columns and 1–10 cells in addition to the standard 8 * 4 game. For each variant, the program stored a ranked list of the players with the longest winning streaks. There was also a tournament system that allowed people to compete to win difficult hand-picked deals. Paul Alfille describes this early FreeCell environment in more detail in an interview from 2000.\r\n\r\n\r\nSolver complexity\r\nThe FreeCell game has a constant number of cards. This implies that in constant time, a person or computer could list all of the possible moves from a given start configuration and discover a winning set of moves or, assuming the game cannot be solved, the lack thereof. To perform an interesting complexity analysis one must construct a generalized version of the FreeCell game with 4 * n cards. This generalized version of the game is NP-complete; it is unlikely that any algorithm more efficient than a brute-force search exists that can find solutions for arbitrary generalized FreeCell configurations.\r\n\r\nThere are 52! (i.e., 52 factorial), or approximately 8*1067, distinct deals. However, some games are effectively identical to others because suits assigned to cards are arbitrary or columns can be swapped. After taking these factors into account, there are approximately 1.75*1064 distinct games.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9N985JP4S6T7","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"8 Ball Billiards 3D","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.45015.13537273723463434.c8002b4b-5fd6-4dab-ac94-d8c395e8a775.37154dce-29c3-4c0a-bc7f-21252e374d83","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.10037.13537273723463434.c8002b4b-5fd6-4dab-ac94-d8c395e8a775.1539db3c-493d-4326-87c7-faa5df0b6bba","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.45015.13537273723463434.c8002b4b-5fd6-4dab-ac94-d8c395e8a775.37154dce-29c3-4c0a-bc7f-21252e374d83","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":3.4,"RatingsCount":"21","PackageFamilyNames":["15099SimKidsAdventureGame.8BallBilliards3D_zsk4ancj3a1sw"],"ContentIds":["3c86257e-4f28-deff-6974-63a7e9a080f0","255cdec9-17aa-5263-bf60-0582894b36ba"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"The World's #1 Pool game - Relaxed Game of 8 Ball Billiards 3D \r\n🎱 8 Ball Billiards 3D is the most popular 8 ball billiards game. 🎱\r\nSidespin, masse, jump ball, clearance with one break!

As you go about your mission, you'll explore every detail of how the station's crew lived and worked, finding the clues that add up to a gripping story of trust, fear, and resolve in the face of disaster.\n\nAt the heart of Tacoma is the facility's digital surveillance system, which has captured 3D recordings of pivotal moments in the crew's life on the station. As you explore, echoes of these captured moments surround you. You'll use your ability to rewind, fast-forward, and move through the physical space of these complex, interwoven scenes to examine events from every angle, reconstructing the multi-layered narrative as you explore.\n\nTacoma is the next game from the creators of Gone Home, and carries on that tradition of detailed, immersive, and powerful storytelling, while pulling players deeper into the narrative than ever before.\n\nFeatures:\n\n·\tA Richly Layered Story Experience: Six crewmembers lived and worked on space station Tacoma, forming relationships, experiencing love and loss, and facing crisis together. Discover not just what happened to these people, but what makes them who they are, through your role as an interactive investigator. The story is told through a series of fully voiced and animated interactive AR scenes, immersing you in the events on Tacoma.\n\n·\tA Groundbreaking Multi-Path Story System: In each section of the station, you are surrounded by digital representations of crewmembers following their own parallel story threads that diverge, recombine, and split off again. Rewind, fast-forward, and move through these scenes' chronologies as they swirl around you. Your interactive tools allow you to discover the tightly-knotted narrative from every angle, and in every detail.\n\n·\tA Deeply Interactive Gameworld: Explore Tacoma Station both physically and digitally. Unlock doors and drawers to find meaningful objects, notes, and physical artifacts, while simultaneously exploring extensive records of the crew's digital communications and personal thoughts. Every facet of the crew's experience on Tacoma is part of your investigation.\n\n·\tA Vision of the Future: Experience life in the year 2088. Discover a rich fictional universe that depicts humanity's expansion into low-Earth orbit and beyond. A deeply-imagined speculative vision of the near future from the award-winning story team behind Gone Home and BioShock 2: Minerva's Den.\n\n·\tA Compact Narrative Experience: Tacoma is estimated to take around 2 to 5 hours to complete. How deep you dig and how much detail you find is up to you. Tacoma is a non-combat, non-puzzle-focused game. The details of the story and gameworld are there for you to discover at your own pace.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9PGLL3TH2SHQ","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Mini Golf King 3D","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.31626.14183004599546847.aba5c392-56a9-4c33-8ed4-b9399028c088.1db4b004-34f1-4372-b35d-1511b66436b5","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.13840.14183004599546847.aba5c392-56a9-4c33-8ed4-b9399028c088.82a1e8f7-52fa-4e83-aad5-138822caddab","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.31626.14183004599546847.aba5c392-56a9-4c33-8ed4-b9399028c088.1db4b004-34f1-4372-b35d-1511b66436b5","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":5.0,"RatingsCount":"3","PackageFamilyNames":["22876NinjaBlitzWarGames.MiniGolfKing3D_7sghpx39xtehr"],"ContentIds":["b704b100-1bdb-9d5c-ea22-8c5707e6fe89","41e0a8ff-1d23-3801-f4f5-58f5d66b5555"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Mini Golf King 3D is a free sports mini golf game!

The 2019 edition of Bridge features faster and stronger game play with smoother user interface.\r\n\r\nBridge is a card game played by four players who form two partnerships. Players within a partnership face each other across the bridge table. Traditionally, the players are referred to by the points of the compass - North, East, South and West. The two partnerships are North/South and East/West. Games are played to the best of three.  During bidding, each partnership exchanges information to decide a contract. Once established the cards are played with the declarer attempting to fulfill the contract + the opponents attempting to defeat it.\r\n\r\nBridge includes the all new state of the art advanced Bridge card play engine playing at a significantly stronger level. By analysing the probable permutations of the remaining cards Bridge will frequently find an extra trick to make or defeat a contract. \r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE:\r\nThis game is ad-funded.

The aim of the game is to get all of the cards in order (King to Ace). To win, you must remove all the cards from the table by building columns organized in descending order, from king to ace. At intermediate (2-suits) and advanced (4-suites) levels, the cards must also match suit. When you succeed in building a sequentially-ordered column, it flies off the table. If you run out of moves, click the pile at the bottom of the table to deal a new row of cards. \r\n\r\nIn our version we largely tried to recreate a full experience of that version in a tiny download package, along with multiple suite versions of the game, hints and undo (top right corner of the title bar). But there are also some minor twists to make it easier to play on a small factor mobile devices. In particular you don't have to select a card to move - drag and drop entire column - only appropriate cards will move, the rest will snap back. The scoring is also changed - only number of moves counted - the lower the score - the better.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NNN3SN3T6J1","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Extreme Car Racing Simulator 3D","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.52898.13735103520114822.eda506bc-e1c5-4853-ba26-4e4a7c1f59cf.8fe29a37-d12a-4314-91f8-89961198cddd","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.44594.13735103520114822.eda506bc-e1c5-4853-ba26-4e4a7c1f59cf.096b68f6-1a0d-4e65-8a5e-ccb905dceaf1","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":4.3,"RatingsCount":"22","PackageFamilyNames":["41633NinjaBlitzWarGames.ExtremeCarRacingSimulator3_qnq5anfshaxke"],"ContentIds":["c2d7d875-7ada-5df6-2e8f-dcd08aeb8a2d"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Extreme Car Racing Simulator 3D - The best car driving simulator game of 2018 comes with the most realistic driving physics huge open world, most wanted addictive gameplay and endless fun!

In the decades to follow, Tetris became one of the most successful and recognizable  games, appearing on nearly every gaming platform available. This App is based on the classic Tetris, a new development in windows10!\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE\r\n\r\nThe goal of Tetris is to score as many points as possible by clearing horizontal lines of Blocks. The player must rotate, move, and drop the falling Tetriminos inside the Matrix (playing field). Lines are cleared when they are filled with Blocks and have no empty spaces.\r\n\r\nAs lines are cleared, the level increases and Tetriminos fall faster, making the game progressively more challenging.
